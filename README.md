# Enigma
   
## Self-Assessment

### Functionality
3 - Enigma Class was successfully implemented with encrypt and decrypt methods. The encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces were successfully implemented, as well.

### Object-Oriented Programming
3 - The project is broken into 4 classes that have single responsibilities. The classes are: Key, Offset, Shift, and Enigma. No more than 2 methods are longer than 7 lines (only the encrypt and decrypt methods in Enigma class exceed this limit). No class is longer than 100 lines. The variable and method names relay its purpose.

### Test-Drive Development
3 - Test coverage is at 100%. Methods are tested at both the unit and integration level. Git history will show that tests were written before implementation code. Mocks and stubs were not used.

### Version Control
3 - There were 73 commits and 11 pull requests. Git history will show that each commit has only one piece of functionality.
