do you remember the 21st night of september?
love was changing the minds of pretenders
while chasing the clouds away

our hearts were ringing
in the key that our souls were singing
as we danced in the night
remember how the stars stole the night away

hey hey hey
ba de ya, say do you remember
ba de ya, dancing in september
ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

ba duda, ba duda, ba duda, badu
ba duda, badu, ba duda, badu
ba duda, badu, ba duda
